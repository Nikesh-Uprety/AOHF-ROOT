‚ö†Ô∏è Urgent bug fixes and UI improvements are required for the following sections of the CTF platform. Apply clean UI/UX principles with a hacker-themed design. Prioritize mobile responsiveness and usability.

üßÆ Leaderboard Page (High Priority)
Bug: Bar chart for user progress is not rendering correctly.

Fix: Replace the current bar chart with an advanced CTF-style progress tracking UI. Use a tracking progress bar (horizontal or segmented) like in professional CTF platforms (refer to provided sample image).

Progress bar should show:

Total challenges solved

Challenge categories (e.g., Web, Crypto)

Percentage solved

Badge or level system (optional)

üîê Login Page (High Priority)
Change: Replace the Username input field with an Email input field.

Update both frontend and backend validation/auth logic accordingly.

üêû Challenge Creation Page ‚Äî UI Bugs
Fix the following UI issues on the admin challenge creation page and challenge list display:

Description Overflow

Bug: Long descriptions overflow outside the challenge card/container.

Fix: Add max height or scrollable area. Use ellipsis + ...view more functionality.

Attachment Not Updating

Bug: Attachments are not reflected/visible after updating a challenge.

Fix: Ensure the attachment field reflects uploaded or linked files properly post-update.

New Line Issue in Description

Bug: Newlines in the description are saved but not displayed on the challenge view.

Fix: Preserve newline formatting (\n ‚Üí <br/> or equivalent in frontend).

Fixed Challenge Card Layout

Enhancement:

Make each challenge card fixed size with:

Title

Category

Partial Description

Attachment Button

If the description exceeds a certain character limit, truncate it with "‚Ä¶view more" at the end.

On click: expand modal or navigate to full challenge view.

Attachment Handling (Drive + URL Support)

Enhancement:

Rename the current Attachment field to: Challenge URL.

Add a new field: Google Drive / External Attachment.

In the challenge card:

Render a small download button for both fields.

Ensure proper handling of Google Drive preview/download links.
