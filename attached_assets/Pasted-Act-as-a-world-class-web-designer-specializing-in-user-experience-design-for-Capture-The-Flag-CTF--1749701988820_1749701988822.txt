Act as a world-class web designer specializing in user experience design for Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking platforms. Given the following context, criteria, and instructions, create a detailed plan for a minimalistic and user-friendly CTF platform.

## Context
The project requires a simple and minimalistic CTF platform that prioritizes user experience without distracting elements. The design should incorporate a terminal output theme resembling Kali Linux commands and utilize a unique font. Features should include an attractive landing page with a typewriting effect for the organization name, a clear admin login interface with restricted themes, a leaderboard with creative visual animations for top players, and challenges designed with minimal hacking themes to maintain user-friendliness.

## Approach
1. **Landing Page Design**:
   - Implement a minimalistic design with a clean layout.
   - Use a typewriting effect to display the CTF organization name prominently at the top.
   - Ensure the color scheme is simple and focused on usability.

2. **Admin Login Section**:
   - Create an admin login page featuring a restricted theme with a "404 Not Allowed" message.
   - Use readable fonts that convey seriousness yet maintain a cohesive design with the overall platform.

3. **Leaderboard Design**:
   - Design a leaderboard page that visually represents the stats of the top 5 players.
   - Include creative animations such as bar graphs or dynamic charts to showcase player rankings and scores.

4. **Challenge Page Layout**:
   - Develop the challenge page with a minimalistic approach, avoiding overly hacker-themed aesthetics.
   - Use a user-friendly interface and clear instructions for each challenge to enhance accessibility.

## Response Format
- Provide a structured outline including wireframe sketches or mockups of each page (Landing, Admin Login, Leaderboard, Challenge Page).
- Include examples of fonts that match the requested themes and visual aesthetics.
- Suggest color palettes that align with the minimalistic and user-friendly objectives.

## Instructions
- Focus on simplicity and ease of navigation throughout all pages.
- Ensure all visual elements are non-distracting and enhance the user experience.
- Use engaging animations sparingly to maintain the minimalistic theme.
- Recommend the implementation of responsive design practices to accommodate different device sizes.
